# Asymmetric Regular Solution Model

This notebook provides a complete implementation of the asymmetric regular solution model for miscibility gap analysis.

## Introduction
The asymmetric regular solution model is used to describe the phase behavior of binary mixtures, particularly in cases where one component is significantly different from the other in terms of size or polarity.

## Model Formulation
The key equations governing the model include:

1. **Gibbs Free Energy**: The Gibbs free energy for the system can be written as:
   
   \[ G = N_1 \mu_1 + N_2 \mu_2 \]
   
   where \( N_1 \) and \( N_2 \) are the number of moles of each component, and \( \mu_1 \) and \( \mu_2 \) are the chemical potentials.

2. **Chemical Potentials**:  The chemical potentials are given by:
   
   \[ \mu_1 = \mu_{1}^{\circ} + RT \ln \phi_1 \]
   \[ \mu_2 = \mu_{2}^{\circ} + RT \ln \phi_2 \]
   
   where \( \phi_1 \) and \( \phi_2 \) are the mole fractions of components 1 and 2.

## Implementation
In this section, we will implement the model using Python. The following libraries will be used:
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Setup
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

### Calculate Gibbs Free Energy
```python
def gibbs_free_energy(N1, N2, mu1, mu2):
    return N1 * mu1 + N2 * mu2
```

### Phase Equilibrium
The phase equilibrium condition is determined by setting the derivative of the Gibbs free energy with respect to the mole fractions to zero.

## Conclusion
This model provides a useful framework for understanding the behavior of binary mixtures under varying conditions of temperature and pressure. Further work can include experimental comparisons and refinement of the model based on observed data.
